# Riddle-Game
The Riddle Game is a fun and interactive Java-based console application that challenges players with thought-provoking riddles. The game features a collection of riddles stored in an array, along with their corresponding answers and hints. When the game starts, a riddle is randomly selected and displayed to the player, who must then attempt to guess the correct answer.  

If the player provides the correct answer, they receive positive feedback, and their score increases. However, if they answer incorrectly, the game offers them the option to receive a hint to assist them in solving the riddle. This adds an element of learning and engagement, making the experience more enjoyable. The game continues by allowing players to answer more riddles or exit whenever they choose.  

This project effectively demonstrates key Java programming concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional statements, user input handling, and random selection. By implementing a simple yet engaging logic, the game provides an interactive way to test problem-solving skills while reinforcing fundamental coding principles.
